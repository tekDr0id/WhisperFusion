Here are the errors and warnings present in the log file, listed chronologically.

## 📜 Build-Time Warnings & Errors

These issues occurred during the `docker compose build` process. They were non-fatal, and the build completed successfully, but they highlight potential configuration issues.

### Dockerfile Build Warning

* **Warning:** A non-standard casing was used in the Dockerfile.
* **Reference:**
    * ``: `#2 WARN: FromAsCasing: 'as' and 'FROM' keywords' casing do not match (line 4)`

### `debconf` Frontend Errors

* **Error:** The `debconf` utility, which configures packages, was **unable to initialize the `Dialog` or `Readline` frontends**. This is common in non-interactive Docker builds because a terminal (`TERM`) isn't set, or the `Term::ReadLine.pm` Perl module is missing. The system safely fell back to the `Teletype` frontend.
* **References:**
    * ``: `#7 29.44 debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Dialog`
    * ``: `#7 29.44 debconf: (TERM is not set, so the dialog frontend is not usable.)`
    * ``: `#7 29.44 debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Readline`
    * ``: `#7 29.44 debconf: (Can't locate Term/ReadLine.pm in @INC...`
    * ``: `#7 30.66 debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Dialog`
    * ``: `#7 30.66 debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Readline`
    * ``: `#7 30.66 debconf: (Can't locate Term/ReadLine.pm in @INC...`
    * ``: `#7 52.46 debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Dialog`
    * ``: `#14 48.99 debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Dialog`

### `update-alternatives` Warnings

* **Warning:** The `update-alternatives` utility skipped creating symbolic links for manual (man) pages. This is normal for minimal container environments that don't include the man pages.
* **References:**
    * ``: `#7 51.78 update-alternatives: warning: skip creation of /usr/share/man/man1/fakeroot.1.gz...`
    * ``: (Multiple warnings from `update-alternatives` for `faked`)
    * ``: (Multiple warnings from `update-alternatives` for `faked` and `lzma`)
    * ``: (Multiple warnings from `update-alternatives` for `lzma` variants)
    * ``: (Multiple warnings from `update-alternatives` for `lzma` variants)
    * ``: (Multiple warnings from `update-alternatives` for `rsh`, `rlogin`, `rcp`)
    * ``: (Multiple warnings from `update-alternatives` for `automake`, `aclocal`)
    * ``: `#7 59.15 update-alternatives: warning: skip creation of /usr/share/man/man1/c++.1.gz...`
    * ``: `#7 59.27 update-alternatives: warning: skip creation of /usr/share/man/man1/f95.1.gz...`
    * ``: `#7 59.28 update-alternatives: warning: skip creation of /usr/share/man/man1/f77.1.gz...`
    * ``: (Multiple warnings from `update-alternatives` for `mpirun`, `mpiexec`)
    * ``: (Multiple warnings from `update-alternatives` for `mpi` compilers)
    * ``: `#7 59.36 update-alternatives: warning: skip creation of /usr/share/man/man1/mpifort.1.gz...`

### `apt` CLI Warning

* **Warning:** The log shows a **warning that `apt` does not have a stable CLI interface** and should be used with caution in scripts. This is a standard `apt` notice.
* **References:**
    * ``: `#14 1.175 WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface.`
    * ``: `#14 10.13 WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface.`

### `FutureWarning` (pynvml)

* **Warning:** A `FutureWarning` was issued stating that **the `pynvml` package is deprecated** and `nvidia-ml-py` should be used instead. This warning appeared multiple times during the `setup-whisperfusion.sh` script execution.
* **References:**
    * ``: `#14 76.90 ... FutureWarning: The pynvml package is deprecated.`
    * ``: `#14 80.87 ... FutureWarning: The pynvml package is deprecated.`
    * ``: `#14 170.2 ... FutureWarning: The pynvml package is deprecated.`
    * ``: `#14 172.2 ... FutureWarning: The pynvml package is deprecated.`

## 💥 Runtime Fatal Errors

These errors occurred after the container started (`docker compose up`) and caused the `whisperfusion-1` container to crash.

### Python `ImportError`

* **Error:** The application failed with a `Traceback` originating from `/root/TensorRT-LLM-examples/whisper/build.py`. The script ultimately failed because it **could not import the name `cudart` from the `cuda` module** (`ImportError: cannot import name 'cudart' from 'cuda' (unknown location)`). This indicates an issue with the CUDA Python bindings or the environment setup.
* **References:**
    * ``: `whisperfusion-1  | Traceback (most recent call last):`
    * ``: `whisperfusion-1  |   File "/root/TensorRT-LLM-examples/whisper/build.py", line 20, in <module>`

    * ``: `whisperfusion-1  |     from cuda import cudart`
    * ``: `whisperfusion-1  | ImportError: cannot import name 'cudart' from 'cuda' (unknown location)`

### Container Exit

* **Error:** As a direct result of the `ImportError`, the main process inside the container stopped, and the **container exited with a non-zero exit code (1)**.
* **Reference:**
    * ``: `whisperfusion-1 exited with code 1`
